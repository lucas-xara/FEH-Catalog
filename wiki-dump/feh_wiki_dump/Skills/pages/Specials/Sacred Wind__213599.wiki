|effect=When Special triggers, boosts damage by 40% of unit's Spd and neutralizes foe's "reduces damage by X%" effects from non-Special skills. After combat, if unit's Special triggered, restores 20 HP to unit and all allies (healing does not stack if triggered more than once per combat; HP restored to allies even if unit's HP reaches 0) and grants【Canto (１)】 to unit for 1 turn.<br><br>【Canto (１)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move １ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)
