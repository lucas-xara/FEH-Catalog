Skill effect's Range is treated as 2, including by skill effects determined by attack Range, like Pavise and Aegis. This Style can be used only once per turn.<br>――――――――――――――――――――<br><br>【Potent Follow X%】<br>Triggers an additional follow-up attack immediately after unit's standard follow-up attack and deals damage = X% of unit's normal attack damage (if unit cannot make a follow-up attack, this effect triggers when the standard follow-up attack would occur; this effect is treated like a follow-up attack, so effects like "reduce damage by X%" still apply, but this effect is not affected by effects that prevent follow-ups or "attacks twice" effects; only highest value applied; does not stack).<br><br>【Style】<br>Change Style using the Style button at the bottom of the screen.<br><br>A unit's Style is only active when that unit is taking an action. When unit is equipped with a skill that has a Style, unit will not be able to use skills like Duo Skills or Harmonized Skills. Style use is disabled when unit is deployed using Pair Up or when unit is equipped with multiple skills that have a Style.
