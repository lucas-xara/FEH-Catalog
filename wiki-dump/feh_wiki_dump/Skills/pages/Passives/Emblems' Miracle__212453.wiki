|1effect=Unit can counterattack regardless of foe's range. If unit is within 3 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+9 to unit during combat and reduces damage from foe's first attack during combat and from area-of-effect Specials (excluding Røkkr area-of-effect Specials) by 40% ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes). If the number of allies within 3 spaces of unit ≥ 3 and foe initiates combat, if unit's HP > 1 and foe would reduce unit's HP to 0 during combat, unit survives with 1 HP, and after combat, restores 99 HP to unit (effect only triggers for player's team once per map and does not stack with non-Special effects that allow unit to survive with 1 HP if foe's attack would reduce unit's HP to 0; when any other such effect triggers on a unit granted this effect, this effect will trigger too).
