|1effect=At start of turn, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, inflicts Spd/Def-7,【Frozen】, and【Guard】on closest foes and foes within 2 spaces of those foes through their next actions.<br><br>At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def-5 on foe, unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, deals damage = 20% of unit's Def, and reduces damage from foe's attacks by 20% of unit's Def during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials).<br><br>【Frozen】<br>Reduces inflicted unit's follow-up ability and increases foe's follow-up ability through unit's next action:<br><br>Increases Spd difference necessary for unit to make a follow-up attack by X and decreases Spd difference necessary for foe to make a follow-up attack by X during combat (if foe's Def > unit's Def, X = 10 + difference between Def stats × 2; otherwise, X = 10). (For example, if Spd difference necessary increases by 10, Spd must be ≥ 15 more than foe's Spd to make a follow-up attack; stacks with similar skills.)<br><br>【Guard】<br>Inflicts Special cooldown charge -1 on target per attack during combat through its next action. (Only highest value applied. Does not stack.)
