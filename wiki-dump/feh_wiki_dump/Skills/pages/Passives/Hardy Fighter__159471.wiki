|1effect=Neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks during combat. At the start of turn 1, if foe's attack can trigger unit's Special, grants Special cooldown count-1. If foe's attack triggers unit's Special and Special has the "reduces damage by X%" effect, Special triggers twice. (Example: if Special has the "reduces damage by 50%" effect and no other damage reduction effects trigger, reduces initial damage by 50%, then reduces remaining damage by 50% for a total damage reduction of 75%.) Each Special trigger is calculated as a separate activation.

{{Shield Pulse notes}}
*Specials that "reduce damage by X%" activating twice will also have other effects those specials have activate twice, such as {{St|Ice Mirror}}'s effect of boosting the damage of the unit's next attack equal to the total damage reduced when triggered.
**Although the effect of the special will activate twice, the special will only ''visually'' activate once.
