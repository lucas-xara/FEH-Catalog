|1effect=If foe initiates combat or if unit's HP ≥ 25% at start of combat, inflicts Atk/Def/Res-X on foe (X = 4 + the greater of the difference between Def stats or difference between Res stats (unit's Def/Res minus foe's Def/Res); max 11; if either of unit's stats < foe's stat, difference is treated as 0), unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, grants Special cooldown count-1 to unit before foe's first attack, and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50% during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials).
