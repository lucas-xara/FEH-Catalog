|1effect=At start of turn, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd+6,【Canto (１)】, and the following status to unit and allies within 3 spaces of unit for 1 turn: "neutralizes penalties on unit during combat." At start of turn, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, inflicts Spd/Res-6,【Panic】, and【Discord】on closest foes and any foe within 3 spaces of those foes through their next actions. If unit is within 3 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd+5 to unit and neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat.<br><br>【Canto (１)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move １ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)<br><br>【Panic】<br>Converts bonuses on target into penalties through its next action.<br><br>【Discord】<br>Inflicts Atk/Spd/Def/Res-X on unit during combat (X = 2 + number of allies within 2 spaces of unit; max 5) through its next action.
