==Trivia==
* This skill references a skill of the same name in {{FE|15}}. In {{FE|15}}, this skill is exclusive to the {{St|Royal Sword}}, which in extension was exclusive to [[Alm]], though here it can be used by {{Ut|Celica: Warrior Priestess}}, and with any weapon she equips. In {{FE|2}}, Celica was able to wield the {{St|Royal Sword}}, but {{St|Double Lion}} didn't exist at the time, thus Celica with Double Lion is an impossibility on two fronts.
