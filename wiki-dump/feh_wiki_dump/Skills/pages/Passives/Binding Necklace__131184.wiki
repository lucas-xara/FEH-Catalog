If foe initiates combat or number of allies adjacent to unit ≤ 1, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+3 to unit, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def/Res-3 on foe, and neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat, and also, if foe has bonuses, grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res and inflicts penalty on foe's Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = current bonus on each of foe's stats. Calculates each stat bonus independently.
