|1effect=At start of turn, if unit is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Def/Res+6 and【Warp Bubble】to unit for 1 turn. At start of turn, grants Def/Res+6 and【Warp Bubble】to any support partner within 2 spaces of unit or, if unit is not on a team with unit's support partner, to ally with the highest Def within 2 spaces of unit for 1 turn. If unit is within 2 spaces of an ally, inflicts Special cooldown charge -1 on foe per attack during combat (only highest value applied; does not stack), and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50% during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials). If a foe uses bow, dagger, magic, or staff and initiates combat against an ally within 2 spaces of unit, triggers【Savior】on unit. If unit triggers Savior, grants Atk/Def/Res+4 during combat.<br><br>【Warp Bubble】<br>Foes cannot warp into spaces within 4 spaces of unit. (Does not affect foes with Pass skills or warp effects from structures, like camps and fortresses in Rival Domains.)<br><br>【Savior】<br>Unit takes ally's space, enters combat in ally's place, and receives all after-combat effects.<br><br>Savior will not trigger if ally is on terrain that unit cannot move to or if multiple units are able to use Savior during the same combat. If Savior triggers, after-combat movement effects do not occur.
