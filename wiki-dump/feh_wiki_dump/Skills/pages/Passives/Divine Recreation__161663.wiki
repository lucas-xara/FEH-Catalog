|2effect=If unit initiates combat or foe's HP ≥ 50% at start of combat, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def/Res-4 on foe, reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50% (excluding area-of-effect Specials), reduces damage from foe's first attack by 50% during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and unit's next attack deals damage = total damage reduced from foe's first attack (by any source, including other skills; resets at end of combat).
