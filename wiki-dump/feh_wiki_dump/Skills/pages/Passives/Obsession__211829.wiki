|1effect=At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+9 to unit during combat, unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, foe cannot make a follow-up attack, and also, when unit performs a follow-up attack, neutralizes "reduces damage by X%" effects from foe's non-Special skills (excluding area-of-effect Specials). At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25% and if decreasing the Spd difference necessary to make a follow-up attack by 25 would allow unit to trigger a follow-up attack (excluding guaranteed or prevented follow-ups), triggers【Potent Follow X%】during combat (if unit cannot perform follow-up and attack twice, X = 80; otherwise, X = 40).<br><br>【Potent Follow X%】<br>Triggers an additional follow-up attack immediately after unit's standard follow-up attack and deals damage = X% of unit's normal attack damage (if unit cannot make a follow-up attack, this effect triggers when the standard follow-up attack would occur; this effect is treated like a follow-up attack, so effects like "reduce damage by X%" still apply, but this effect is not affected by effects that prevent follow-ups or "attacks twice" effects; only highest value applied; does not stack).
