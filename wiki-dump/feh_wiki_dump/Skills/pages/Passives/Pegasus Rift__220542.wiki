|1effect=Inflicts Atk/Spd-4 on foe during combat. If unit's Spd + Res ≥ foe's Spd + Res - 10 (excluding effects from【Phantom】), unit deals +X damage (excluding when dealing damage with an area-of-effect Special) and reduces damage from foe's first attack by X during combat (X = unit's Res at start of combat - 30; min 0, max 10; "first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, foe cannot make a follow-up attack, and increases the Spd difference necessary for foe to make a follow-up attack by 20 during combat (Spd must be ≥ 25 to make a follow-up attack; stacks with similar skills).<br><br>【Phantom】<br>If a skill effect compares unit's stats to foe or ally stats, treats unit's stats as if granted +X.
