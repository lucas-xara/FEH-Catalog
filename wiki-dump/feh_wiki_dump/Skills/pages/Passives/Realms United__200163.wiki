|1effect=Unit can counterattack regardless of foe's range. If foe initiates combat or foe's HP ≥ 75% at start of combat, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def/Res-7 on foe and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 7 during combat (for standard attacks, "first attack" means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes).
