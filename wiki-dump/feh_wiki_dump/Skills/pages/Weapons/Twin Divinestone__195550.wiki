|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1).<br>Effective against dragon foes. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit during combat and restores 7 HP to unit after combat, and also, if unit's Res > foe's Res, unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack and reduces damage from attacks during combat and from area-of-effect Specials (excluding Røkkr area-of-effect Specials) by percentage = difference between stats × 4 (max 40%). If unit's HP ≥ 25% at start of combat, unit's Res ≥ foe's Res+5 during combat, and foe's attack can trigger foe's Special, inflicts Special cooldown count+1 on foe (cannot exceed foe's maximum Special cooldown count) and grants Special cooldown count-1 to unit before foe's first attack. If foe's Range = 2, calculates damage using the lower of foe's Def or Res.
