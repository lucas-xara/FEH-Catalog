If unit initiates combat or if foe's HP ≥ 75% at start of combat, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 40% during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and restores 7 HP to unit after combat.

Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)
