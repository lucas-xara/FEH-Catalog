|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1).<br>Effective against dragon foes. If foe's Range = 2, calculates damage using the lower of foe's Def or Res.<br><br>At start of player phase or enemy phase, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, inflicts Atk/Res-7,【Frozen】, and【Guard】on closest foes and any foes within 2 spaces of those foes through their next actions.<br><br>At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res = number of allies within 3 rows or 3 columns centered on unit × 3, + 5 (max 14), deals damage = 15% of foe's Atk (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50% during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials).<br><br>【Frozen】<br>Reduces inflicted unit's follow-up ability and increases foe's follow-up ability through unit's next action:<br><br>Increases Spd difference necessary for unit to make a follow-up attack by X and decreases Spd difference necessary for foe to make a follow-up attack by X during combat (if foe's Def > unit's Def, X = 10 + difference between Def stats × 2; otherwise, X = 10). (For example, if Spd difference necessary increases by 10, Spd must be ≥ 15 more than foe's Spd to make a follow-up attack; stacks with similar skills.)<br><br>【Guard】<br>Inflicts Special cooldown charge -1 on target per attack during combat through its next action. (Only highest value applied. Does not stack.)
