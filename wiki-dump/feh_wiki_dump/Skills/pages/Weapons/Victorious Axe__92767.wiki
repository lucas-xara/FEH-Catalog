|effectSkill1=If unit initiates combat or is not adjacent to an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit during combat and deals damage = 10% of unit's Atk (including when dealing damage with a Special triggered before combat). If unit initiates combat and unit is not adjacent to any ally after combat, grants another action to unit (once per turn; if a skill effect moves unit after combat, this effect occurs based on unit's final placement after that movement).
