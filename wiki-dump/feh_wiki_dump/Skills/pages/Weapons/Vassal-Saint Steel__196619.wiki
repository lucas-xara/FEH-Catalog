At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, inflicts Spd/Def-X on foe (X = 11 - foe's max Special cooldown count value × 2; min 3; if foe does not have a Special skill, penalty = 3), and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 40% during combat, and also, if unit's Spd ≥ foe's Spd+5, neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat. If unit's HP ≥ 25% at start of combat and unit's Special cooldown count is at its maximum value after combat, grants Special cooldown count-1 to unit after combat.
