|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). Effective against flying foes.<br><br>If unit initiates combat or foe's Range = 2, foe cannot trigger Specials during combat or area-of-effect Specials (excluding Røkkr area-of-effect Specials).<br><br>If unit initiates combat or foe's Range = 2, grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res = 5 + 15% of unit's Spd at start of combat, reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50% (excluding area-of-effect Specials), neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks, and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 70% during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and unit's next attack deals damage = total damage reduced from foe's first attack (by any source, including other skills). Resets at end of combat.
