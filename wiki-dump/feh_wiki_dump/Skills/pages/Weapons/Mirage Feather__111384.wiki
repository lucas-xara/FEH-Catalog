If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd+6 to unit and neutralizes effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks during combat. If unit initiates combat after an ally has already acted, unit can make a follow-up attack before foe can counterattack.
|effectSkill1=Enables【Canto (２)】.<br><br>At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd+5 to unit and neutralizes unit's penalties to Atk/Spd during combat, and also, if unit initiates combat after an ally has already acted, grants an additional Atk/Spd+5 to unit during combat.<br><br>【Canto (２)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move ２ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)
