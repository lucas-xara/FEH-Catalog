|upgradedEffect=Grants Atk+3. If foe initiates combat or foe's HP ≥ 75% at start of combat, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit during combat. If foe initiates combat, reduces damage from area-of-effect Specials (excluding Røkkr area-of-effect Specials) and foe's follow-up attack by 70% ("follow-up attack" normally means only the second strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the third and fourth strikes). At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or if unit is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2 and unit can counterattack regardless of foe's range.
