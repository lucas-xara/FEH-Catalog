|effectSkill1=Enables【Canto (２)】.<br><br>At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk+6 to unit, inflicts Atk-6 on foe, and reduces damage from foe's attacks by 15% of unit's Atk during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and unit's next attack deals damage = total damage reduced from foe's first attack (by any source, including other skills; resets at end of combat), and also, when Special triggers, neutralizes foe's "reduces damage by X%" effects from foe's non-Special skills (excluding area-of-effect Specials).<br><br>【Canto (２)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move ２ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)
