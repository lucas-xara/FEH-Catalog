|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def-X on foe (X = 16 - foe's maximum Special cooldown count value × 2; min 8; if foe is not equipped with a Special, then X = 8), reduces damage from foe's first attack by 40% ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), grants Special cooldown charge +1 to unit per attack (only highest value applied; does not stack), and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by Y% (if foe's Def ≥ foe's Res at start of combat, Y = 70; otherwise, Y = 30) during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and restores 7 HP to unit after combat.
