|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, deals damage = 25% of unit's Def and reduces damage from foe's attacks by 25% of unit's Def (excluding area-of-effect Specials), neutralizes "reduces damage by X%" effects from unit's and foe's non-Special skills (excluding area-of-effect Specials), neutralizes effects that guarantee unit's and foe's follow-up attacks, and increases the Spd difference necessary for unit or foe to make a follow-up attack by 20 during combat (Spd must be ≥ 25 to make a follow-up attack; stacks with similar skills). At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25% and unit initiates combat, grants Special cooldown count-1 to unit before unit's first attack during combat. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25% and foe initiates combat, neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat, and also, if unit deals damage to foe using a Special during combat, restores 10 HP to unit (triggers even if 0 damage is dealt).
