(If support partner is on player team, targets any support partner; otherwise, targets ally with the highest Def on player team, excluding unit.)<br><br>At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or if unit is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2, deals +7 damage when Special triggers, and neutralizes effects that grant "Special cooldown charge +X" to foe or inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit.
|effectSkill1=At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, inflicts penalty on foe's Atk/Spd/Def = number of foes within 3 rows or 3 columns centered on unit × 2, + 5 (max 11), neutralizes foe's bonuses to Atk/Spd, deals damage = 20% of unit's Spd (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 20% of unit's Spd during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes).
