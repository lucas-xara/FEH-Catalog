|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of turn, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Def/Res+6 and "Special cooldown charge +1 per attack during combat (only highest value applied; does not stack)" to unit and allies within 3 spaces of unit for 1 turn. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, grants an additional Atk/Spd/Def/Res+X to unit (X = number of allies within 3 spaces of unit × 3, + 1; max 10; if any space within 2 spaces of unit has a Divine Vein effect applied or counts as difficult terrain, excluding impassable terrain, value is treated as 10), and reduces damage from foe's first attack by X during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and also, when unit deals damage to foe during combat, restores X HP to unit (triggers even if 0 damage is dealt).
