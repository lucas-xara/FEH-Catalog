|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of odd-numbered turns, grants Special cooldown count-2. If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd+6 to unit during combat and deals damage = X% of unit's Spd when Special triggers (X = unit's max Special cooldown count value × 10, + 20). If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, and if unit's Special triggers (excluding area-of-effect Specials), disables non-Special effects that "reduce damage by X%" and prevents foe's Specials that are triggered by unit's attack.
