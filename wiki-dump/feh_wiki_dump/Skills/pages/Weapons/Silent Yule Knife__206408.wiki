|effect=Enables【Canto (Dist.; Max ３)】.<br><br>Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit and grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd = 9 - number of allies adjacent to unit × 2 (min 0), neutralizes effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks, and neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat, and also, if unit initiates combat, reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by percentage = X × 30 and reduces damage from foe's first attack by percentage = X × 30 during combat (X = number of spaces from start position to end position of whoever initiated combat, max 3; if any space within 2 spaces of unit has a Divine Vein effect applied or counts as difficult terrain, excluding impassable terrain, value is treated as 3; "first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes). After combat, if unit attacked, inflicts Def/Res-7 on target and foes within 2 spaces of target through their next actions.<br><br>【Canto (Dist.; Max ３)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move spaces = number of spaces from start position to end position unit moved prior to taking action (max ３).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)
