* Vassal's Blade, along with {{St|Giga Excalibur}}, which came out at the same time, are the first weapons to come out that may give a damage bonus if {{Sgp|Phantom Spd}} is equipped.
* The artwork of Vassal's Blade is based on the sword Karla wields in her [[FireEmblemWikia:File:Karla.png|official artwork]] in {{FE|7}}.
