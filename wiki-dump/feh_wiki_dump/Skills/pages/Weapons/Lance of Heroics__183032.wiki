|effectSkill1=If unit is within 3 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit during combat and bonus to Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = current penalty on each of those stats × 2. (Example: if unit has -7 penalty to Atk, grants Atk+18, for a net bonus of Atk+11.) Calculates each stat bonus independently.
