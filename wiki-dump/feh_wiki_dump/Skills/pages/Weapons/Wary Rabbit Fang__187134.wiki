|effect=Grants Spd+3. Effective against cavalry foes. If unit initiates combat or is not adjacent to an ally, grants Atk/Spd+6 to unit during combat and inflicts penalty on foe's Atk/Def during combat = 20% of unit's Spd at start of combat, and also, after combat, if unit's HP ≤ 90%, grants Special cooldown count-2. At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or if unit is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2, and if unit initiates combat, inflicts Atk/Def-4 on foe during combat and foe cannot make a follow-up attack.
