* The refined effect may be a reference to the skill [[fireemblemwiki:Rally Spectrum|Rally Spectrum]], which is exclusive to the Grandmaster class (the promoted version of the Tactician class) in {{FE|13}}. Both skills grant allies a boost to all stats (except HP) if they are within a few spaces of the user.
** However, Rally Spectrum acts much like other Rally skills in that the user must spend their turn in order to use the skill. The refined effect of Tactical Gale instead acts as a passive skill.
