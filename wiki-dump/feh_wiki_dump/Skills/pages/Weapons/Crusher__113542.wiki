|upgradedEffect=Grants Atk+3. Calculates damage using the lower of foe's Def or Res. If a Rally Assist skill is used by unit, target can move 1 extra space (that turn only; does not stack; no effect on cavalry allies with Range = 2), and afterward, once per turn, grants another action to unit. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 40% during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes).

|effectSkill1=If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit, inflicts penalty on foe's Spd/Def/Res = 6 - current penalty on each of those stats (min: 0; calculates each stat penalty independently; still inflicts penalty on foe even if foe triggers an effect that neutralizes penalties during combat), unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, and if penalty is active on foe's Spd, Def, or Res, deals damage = 15% of unit's Atk (excluding area-of-effect Specials) during combat. If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, after combat, inflicts Spd/Def/Res-6 on foe through its next action.
