|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+X during combat (X = unit's max Special cooldown count value × 2, + 5), grants Special cooldown charge +1 per attack (only highest value applied; does not stack), and neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks during combat. At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or if unit is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2, and if unit initiates combat, inflicts Atk/Def-4 on foe during combat and foe cannot make a follow-up attack.
