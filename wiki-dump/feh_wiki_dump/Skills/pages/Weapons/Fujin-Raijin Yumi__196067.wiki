|effect=Enables【Canto (１)】.<br><br>Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). Effective against flying and armored foes. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd+6 to unit, deals damage = 20% of unit's Spd (including when dealing damage with a Special triggered before combat), and neutralizes effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks during combat, and also, if unit has weapon-triangle advantage or unit's Spd > foe's Spd, foe cannot counterattack.<br><br>【Canto (１)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move １ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)
