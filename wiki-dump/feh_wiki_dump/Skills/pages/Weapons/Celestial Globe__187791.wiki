|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of turn, if unit is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants "unit cannot be slowed by terrain (does not apply to impassable terrain)" and 【Null Follow-Up】to unit and allies within 2 spaces of unit for 1 turn. If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit during combat, deals damage = 20% of unit's Spd (including when dealing damage with a Special triggered before combat), and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50%. (Example: a foe with a "reduce damage by 45%" skill would reduce damage by 23% instead.)<br><br>【Null Follow-Up】<br>If unit's Spd > foe's Spd during combat, neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks for 1 turn.
