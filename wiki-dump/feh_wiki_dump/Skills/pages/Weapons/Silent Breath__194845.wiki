|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). If foe initiates combat or foe's HP ≥ 75% at start of combat, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def/Res-X on foe (X = current bonus on each of foe's stats × 2; example: if foe has +7 bonus to Spd, inflicts Spd-14, for a net penalty of Spd-7; calculates each stat penalty independently), deals damage = 20% of unit's Spd (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and reduces damage from foe's first attacks by 7 during combat ("follow-up attack" normally means only the second strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the third and fourth strikes). If foe's Range = 2, calculates damage using the lower of foe's Def or Res.
