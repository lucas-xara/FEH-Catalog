If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd+6 to unit, neutralizes effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks, grants Special cooldown charge +1 to unit per attack during combat (only highest value applied; does not stack), and after combat, if unit attacked, inflicts status on target and foes within 2 spaces of target preventing counterattacks through their next actions.
