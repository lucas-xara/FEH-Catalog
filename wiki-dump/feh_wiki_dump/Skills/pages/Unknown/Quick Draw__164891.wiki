==Notes==
* Quick Draw does ''not'' [[:Category:Sources of priority changing effects|change the <i>priority</i>, or <i>order</i> of attacks]], so effects such as {{St|Hardy Bearing}} have no effect on Quick Draw.
* Quick Draw allows the player with this Captain Skill to act first every turn unless the opposing player is also using this Captain Skill.
