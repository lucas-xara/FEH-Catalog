{{Captain Skill
|name=Piercing Cold
|effect=At start of turns 2 through 5, if captain is within 6 spaces of a foe, inflicts Spd-7 and【Frozen】 on closest foes to captain and foes within 2 spaces of those foes.<br><br>【Frozen】<br>Reduces inflicted unit's follow-up ability and increases foe's follow-up ability through unit's next action:<br><br>Increases Spd difference necessary for unit to make a follow-up attack by X and decreases Spd difference necessary for foe to make a follow-up attack by X during combat (if foe's Def > unit's Def, X = 10 + difference between Def stats × 2; otherwise, X = 10). (For example, if Spd difference necessary increases by 10, Spd must be ≥ 15 more than foe's Spd to make a follow-up attack; stacks with similar skills.)
