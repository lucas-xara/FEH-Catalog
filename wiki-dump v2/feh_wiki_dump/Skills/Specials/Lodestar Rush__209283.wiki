|effect=Boosts Special damage by 40% of unit's Spd. Neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat. If unit's Special is ready or has triggered during this combat,【Potent Follow X%】has triggered, and X ≤ 99, then X = 100. If unit's or foe's Special is ready or triggered before or during this combat, reduces damage from foe's next attack by 40% (once per combat; excluding area-of-effect Specials).<br><br>【Potent Follow X%】<br>Triggers an additional follow-up attack immediately after unit's standard follow-up attack and deals damage = X% of unit's normal attack damage (if unit cannot make a follow-up attack, this effect triggers when the standard follow-up attack would occur; this effect is treated like a follow-up attack, so effects like "reduce damage by X%" still apply, but this effect is not affected by effects that prevent follow-ups or "attacks twice" effects; only highest value applied; does not stack).
