|effect=Boosts damage by 30% of unit's Spd. If unit's Special is ready and unit's Spd > foe's Spd, reduces damage from area-of-effect Specials (excluding Røkkr area-of-effect Specials) by percentage = difference between stats × 3 (max 30%). At the start of combat, if unit's Special is ready and unit's Spd > foe's Spd, reduces damage from attacks during combat by percentage = difference between stats × 3 (max 30%). (Damage-reduction effects above are considered non-Special effects, so skills like Deadeye still apply.)
