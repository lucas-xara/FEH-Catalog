|1effect=If a skill compares unit's Spd to a foe's or ally's Spd, treats unit's Spd as if granted +7. Inflicts Atk/Spd/Def-5 on foe during combat and grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = current penalty on each of unit's stats × 2 (example: if unit has -7 penalty to Atk, grants Atk+14, for a net bonus of Atk+7; calculates each stat bonus independently), and also, if unit's Spd > foe's Spd, reduces damage from attacks during combat and from area-of-effect Specials (excluding Røkkr area-of-effect Specials) by percentage = difference between stats × 5 (max 50%). If foe is armored or cavalry, reduces damage dealt to unit by X (X = highest total bonuses among unit and allies within 2 spaces of unit; including from area-of-effect Specials), and if foe is not armored or cavalry, reduces damage from foe's first attack by 40% of X during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes).
