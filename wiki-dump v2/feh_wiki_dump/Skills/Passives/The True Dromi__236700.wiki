|1effect=Enables Canto (2).<br><br>When Canto triggers, enables unit to use 【Foul Play】on ally (this effect is not treated as an Assist skill; if similar effects are active, this effect does not trigger).<br><br>For foes within 3 rows or 3 columns centered on unit, inflicts Spd/Def-5 and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50% during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials).<br><br>At start of turn, grants "unit can move 1 extra space (that turn only, does not stack)" and 【Dodge】to unit for 1 turn.<br><br>If【Stall】is active on unit after start-of-turn skills trigger, neutralizes "unit can move 1 extra space" on unit.<br><br>At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, unit deals +7 damage (excluding area-of-effect Specials) and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 7 during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes).<br><br>【Foul Play】<br>Range = 3. Unit and target ally swap spaces.<br><br>【Dodge】<br>If unit's Spd > foe's Spd, reduces damage from attacks during combat and from area-of-effect Specials (excluding Røkkr area-of-effect Specials) by percentage = difference between stats × 4 (max 40%).<br><br>【Stall】<br>If unit has "unit can move 1 extra space," converts that effect into "restricts movement to 1 space" through its next action.
