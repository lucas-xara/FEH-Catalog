{{AoEDamageReduction}}
* The HP threshold and "if Special triggers" conditions apply to the +5 damage.
** [[Area-of-effect Specials]] can also trigger the "if unit's attack can trigger unit's Special" condition and will gain +5 damage from Spurn.
<ul>{{FlatDamage|special=1|5}}</ul>
*** For the +5 damage, the HP threshold is checked at the point of Special activation, as opposed to start of combat.
