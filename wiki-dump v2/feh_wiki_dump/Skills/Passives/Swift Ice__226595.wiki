|1effect=If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+8 to unit, reduces damage from foe's first attack by 30% ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks, and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50% during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials).<br><br>If unit initiates combat against a non-dragon, non-beast infantry foe and unit's Spd ≥ foe's Spd+20, grants "effective against all weapon types" to unit during combat. Otherwise, if unit initiates combat and unit's Spd ≥ foe's Spd+5, grants "effective against all weapon types" to unit during combat.
