|1effect=If foe initiates combat or if unit's HP ≥ 25% at start of combat, inflicts Spd/Def/Res-4 on foe, deals damage = 15% of foe's Atk (excluding area-of-effect Specials), reduces damage from foe's first attack by 10 ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and increases the Spd difference necessary for foe to make a follow-up attack by 10 during combat, and also, if unit's Spd > foe's Spd, neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks during combat.
