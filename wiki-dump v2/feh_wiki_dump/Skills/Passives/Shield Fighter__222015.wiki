==Notes==
{{Temporary debuffs}}
{{CombatCooldownCount|-1}}
*Specials that "reduce damage by X%" activating twice will also have other effects those specials have activate twice, such as {{St|Ice Mirror}}'s effect of boosting the damage of the unit's next attack equal to the total damage reduced when triggered.
**Although the effect of the special will activate twice, the special will only ''visually'' activate once.
