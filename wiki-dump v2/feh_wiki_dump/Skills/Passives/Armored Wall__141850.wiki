==Notes==
*The HP threshold applies both to the Special [[Cooldown|cooldown charge]] -1 inflicted on foe '''and''' the Special [[Cooldown|cooldown charge]] +1 granted on unit.
**The HP threshold is checked at start of combat, and the skill either applies throughout the entire combat, or not at all.
