|1effect=Inflicts Spd/Def-4 on foe and reduces damage from foe's attacks by 7 during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and also, if unit's Special is ready or unit's Special triggered before or during this combat, unit deals +15 damage during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and also, restores 7 HP to unit when unit deals damage to foe during combat.<br><br>If decreasing the Spd difference necessary to make a follow-up attack by 25 would allow unit to trigger a follow-up attack (excluding guaranteed or prevented follow-ups), triggers【Potent Follow X%】during combat (if unit cannot perform follow-up and attack twice, X = 80; otherwise, X = 40).<br><br>【Potent Follow X%】<br>Triggers an additional follow-up attack immediately after unit's standard follow-up attack and deals damage = X% of unit's normal attack damage (if unit cannot make a follow-up attack, this effect triggers when the standard follow-up attack would occur; this effect is treated like a follow-up attack, so effects like "reduce damage by X%" still apply, but this effect is not affected by effects that prevent follow-ups or "attacks twice" effects; only highest value applied; does not stack).
