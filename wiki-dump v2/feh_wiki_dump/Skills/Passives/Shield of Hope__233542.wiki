|1effect=Inflicts Atk/Spd/Def-5 on foe, neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks, and grants effects based on the total value of bonuses on the 3 allies with the highest bonus totals during combat (excluding unit):<br><br>If value ≥ 20, if decreasing the Spd difference necessary to make a follow-up attack by 10 would allow unit to trigger a follow-up attack (excluding guaranteed or prevented follow-ups), triggers【Potent Follow 100%】; if value ≥ 40, if foe initiates combat, unit can counterattack before foe's first attack; and if value ≥ 60, neutralizes effects that prevent unit's counterattacks, and also, if it is first combat initiated by foe that turn, unit can make a follow-up attack before foe's next attack.<br><br>【Potent Follow 100%】<br>Triggers an additional follow-up attack immediately after unit's standard follow-up attack and deals damage = 100% of unit's normal attack damage (if unit cannot make a follow-up attack, this effect triggers when the standard follow-up attack would occur; this effect is treated like a follow-up attack, so effects like "reduce damage by X%" still apply, but this effect is not affected by effects that prevent follow-ups or "attacks twice" effects; only highest value applied; does not stack).
