|1effect=At start of turn, if unit is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants "unit can move 1 extra space (that turn only, does not stack)" and【Canto (１)】to unit for 1 turn, and also grants the following effect to unit based on the value of unit's Special cooldown count: if at its maximum value, grants Special cooldown count-2; if at its maximum value - 1, grants Special cooldown count-1.<br><br>【Canto (１)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move １ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)
