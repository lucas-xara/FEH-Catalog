|1effect=Inflicts Atk/Spd-4 on foe, neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks, and increases the Spd difference necessary for foe to make a follow-up attack by 10 during combat (for example, if Spd difference necessary increases by 10, Spd must be ≥ 15 more than foe's Spd to make a follow-up attack; stacks with similar skills), and also, if unit's Spd ≥ foe's Spd-10, reduces damage from foe's first attack by 10 during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes).
