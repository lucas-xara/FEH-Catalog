|upgradedEffect=Grants Spd+3.<br><br>Grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks, and if it is unit's first combat initiated by foe or first combat initiated by unit that turn, reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 80% during combat, otherwise, by 40% (excluding area-of-effect Specials).<br><br>Restores 10 HP to unit after combat.
|effectSkill1=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1).<br><br>At start of turn, if unit is within 2 spaces of an armored ally, an infantry ally with Range = 1, or a flying ally with Range = 1, grants Atk/Spd+6, "unit can move 1 extra space (that turn only; does not stack),"【Canto (１)】, and "Special cooldown charge +1 to unit per attack during combat (only highest value applied; does not stack)" to unit and those allies for 1 turn.<br><br>If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit and unit deals damage = 20% of unit's Spd during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials).<br><br>【Canto (１)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move １ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)
