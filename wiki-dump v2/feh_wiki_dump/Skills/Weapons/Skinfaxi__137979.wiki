|effect=Grants Spd+3 and【Pathfinder】. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 and bonus to Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = current penalty on each of those stats × 2. (Example: if unit has -7 penalty to Atk, grants Atk+19, for a net bonus of Atk+12.) Calculates each stat bonus independently.<br><br>【Pathfinder】<br>When an ally moves through unit's space, that space is counted as 0 spaces moved instead of 1 space. (Unit's space can be freely added to ally's normal movement. Applies only to allies with movement types that allow movement through unit's space.)

|effectSkill1=If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def-4 on foe, inflicts penalty on foe's Atk/Spd/Def during combat = current bonus on each of foe's stats × 2 (calculates each stat penalty independently; example: if foe has +7 bonus to Atk, inflicts Atk-18, for a net penalty of Atk-11), deals damage = 10% of unit's Atk (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 40% during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes).
