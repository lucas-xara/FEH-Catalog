|effect=Enables【Canto (Rem.)】.<br><br>Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). Unit attacks twice (even if foe initiates combat, unit attacks twice). If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, inflicts Atk/Res-6 on foe during combat, deals damage = Y during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and reduces the effect of foe's non-Special "reduces damage by X%" skills by percentage = Y × 4 during combat (Y = highest total penalties among target and foes within 2 spaces of target; example: if Y × 4 = 64, a foe with a "reduces damage by 45%" skill would reduce damage by 17% instead).<br><br>【Canto (Rem.)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move spaces = any movement not already used that turn. (If unit used a movement skill that warped them, its remaining movement is 0.)<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)
