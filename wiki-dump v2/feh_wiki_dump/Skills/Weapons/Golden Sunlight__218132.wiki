|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1).<br><br>If unit initiates combat or if foe's HP ≥ 75% at start of combat, grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res = 5 + number of foes within 3 rows or 3 columns centered on unit × 3 (max 14; treated as 14 starting in unit's second combat in player phase and enemy phase), deals damage = 20% of unit's Spd (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50% during combat (excluding area-of-effect Specials). If unit initiates combat, reduces damage from foe's first attack during combat by 70% ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and also, grants another action to unit after combat and inflicts "restricts movement to 1 space" on unit and Pair Up cohort through their next action. (Will not trigger again for 2 turns after triggering.)
