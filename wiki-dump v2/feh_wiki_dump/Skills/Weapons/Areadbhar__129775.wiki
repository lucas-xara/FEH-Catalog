|upgradedEffect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1).<br>If a skill compares unit's Spd to a foe's or ally's Spd, treats unit's Spd as if granted +7. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit during combat and restores 7 HP to unit after combat, and also, if unit's Spd > foe's Spd, reduces damage from attacks during combat and from area-of-effect Specials (excluding Røkkr area-of-effect Specials) by percentage = difference between stats × 4 (max 40%). (If area-of-effect Special triggers outside of combat, checks stats and conditions for damage reduction at time of trigger and again at start of combat.)
|effectSkill1=If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit, neutralizes effects that grant "Special cooldown charge +X" to foe or inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit, and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduces damage by X%" skills by 50% during combat (example: a foe with a "reduces damage by 45%" skill would reduce damage by 23% instead).
