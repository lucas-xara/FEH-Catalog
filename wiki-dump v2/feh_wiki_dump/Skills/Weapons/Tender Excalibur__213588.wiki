|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). Effective against flying foes. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, grants Atk/Spd+X to unit (X = 9, - 3 × number of allies with HP ≤ 40%; min 0), neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks, and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 30% during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and also, if unit's attack can trigger unit's Special, grants Special cooldown count-1 to unit before unit's first attack and Special cooldown count-1 to unit before unit's first follow-up attack during combat.
