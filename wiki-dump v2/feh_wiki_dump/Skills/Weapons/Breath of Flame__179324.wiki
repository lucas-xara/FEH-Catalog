|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of turn, if Special cooldown count is at its maximum value, grants Special cooldown count-1. If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk+6 to unit and inflicts Atk-6 on foe during combat, unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50%. (Example: a foe with a "reduce damage by 45%" skill would reduce damage by 23% instead.) If foe's Range = 2, calculates damage using the lower of foe's Def or Res.
