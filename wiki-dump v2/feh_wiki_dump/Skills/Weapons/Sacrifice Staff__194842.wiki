|effect=Foe cannot counterattack. Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1; max cooldown count value cannot be reduced below 1). If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit and neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat. Grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 during combat and "if unit's HP > 1 and foe would reduce unit's HP to 0 during combat, unit survives with 1 HP and after combat, restores 99 HP to unit" to allies within 2 spaces of unit (effect only triggers for player's team once per map and does not stack with non-Special effects that allow unit to survive with 1 HP if foe's attack would reduce unit's HP to 0; when any other such effect triggers on an ally granted this effect, this effect will trigger too).
