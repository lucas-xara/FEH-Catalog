At start of turn, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def/Res-5, 【Sabotage】, and【Stall】on closest foes within 5 spaces of unit and foes within 2 spaces of those foes through their next actions. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def/Res-5 on foe during combat and unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, and also, if a stat penalty is active on any foe within 2 spaces of target, neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat.<br><br>【Sabotage】<br>Inflicts penalty on unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = highest penalty on each stat between unit and allies within 2 spaces of unit through its next action. Calculates each stat penalty independently.<br><br>【Stall】<br>If unit has "unit can move 1 extra space," converts that effect into "restricts movement to 1 space" through its next action.
