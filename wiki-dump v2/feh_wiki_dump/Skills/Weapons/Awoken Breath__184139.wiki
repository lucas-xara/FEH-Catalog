|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). Effective against dragons. If unit is within 3 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit during combat, grants Special cooldown charge +1 to unit per attack during combat (only highest value applied; does not stack), neutralizes foe's bonuses (from skills like Fortify, Rally, etc.) during combat, and also, if foe's attack can trigger their Special and unit's Res ≥ foe's Res+5, inflicts Special cooldown count+1 on foe before foe's first attack during combat (cannot exceed foe's maximum Special cooldown). If foe's Range = 2, calculates damage using the lower of foe's Def or Res.
