|upgradedEffect=Effective against flying foes. Grants Spd+3. If【Bonus】is active on unit or if【Penalty】 is active on foe, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def/Res-5 on foe during combat. If unit initiates combat, reduces damage from foe's first attack during combat by percentage = total bonuses on unit and penalties on foe × 3 (max 60%), and also, if total bonuses on unit and penalties on foe ≥ 10, neutralizes effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks during combat. (Example: if unit has a +5 bonus and foe has a -5 penalty, the calculated total will be 10.)<br><br>【Bonus】<br>All effects that last "for 1 turn" or "that turn only." Includes bonuses granted by a skill like Rally or Hone and positive status effects (extra movement or effects like Dominance).<br><br>【Penalty】<br>All effects that last "on foe through its next action." Includes penalties inflicted by a skill like Panic or Threaten and negative status effects (preventing counterattacks, restricting movement, or the effects of a skill like Triangle Adept or Guard).

|effectSkill1=At start of turn, if any foes are within 3 columns or 3 rows centered on unit, inflicts Def-7 on those foes through their next actions, and grants Atk+6 to unit for 1 turn. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd+5 during combat, grants additional bonus to unit's Atk during combat = current bonus on unit's Atk, and inflicts penalty on foe's Def during combat = current penalty on foe's Def.
