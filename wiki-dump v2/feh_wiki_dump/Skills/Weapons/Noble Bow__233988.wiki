|effect=Effective against flying foes.<br><br>For foes within 3 rows or 3 columns centered on unit, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def/Res-5 and neutralizes foe's bonuses during combat, and those foes cannot recover HP during or after combat. (When an effect such as 【Feud】is triggered for allies, excluding unit, that effect will also neutralize this skill's "cannot recover HP after combat" effect on their foes.)<br><br>At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res = 10% of unit's Spd at start of combat and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 7 during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes).<br><br>【Feud】<br>Disables all ally skills (excluding unit's) during combat through unit's next action.
