At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk+6 to unit and inflicts Atk-6 on foe during combat, neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks, foe cannot make a follow-up attack, and also, if foe's attack can trigger their Special and unit's Res ≥ foe's Res+5 during combat, inflicts Special cooldown count+1 on foe before foe's first attack. (Cannot exceed the foe's maximum Special cooldown.) If foe's Range = 2, calculates damage using the lower of foe's Def or Res.
