|upgradedEffect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1).<br>Effective against flying foes.<br><br>If number of allies adjacent to unit ≤ 1, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, unit can counterattack regardless of foe's range, and neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat, and also, when unit deals damage to foe during combat, restores 7 HP to unit (triggers even if 0 damage is dealt).
|effectSkill1=At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit, inflicts penalty on foe's Atk/Spd/Def = 8 - number of allies adjacent to unit × 2 (min 0), and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 20% of unit's Spd during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and unit's next attack deals damage = total damage reduced from foe's first attack (by any source, including other skills; resets at end of combat).
