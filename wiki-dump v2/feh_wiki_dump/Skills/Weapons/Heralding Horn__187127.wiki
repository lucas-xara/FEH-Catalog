|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). If foe initiates combat or if foe's HP ≥ 75% at start of combat, grants Atk+6 to unit and inflicts Atk-6 on foe during combat, and also grants the following effects based on the number of allies within 3 spaces: if ≥ 1 ally, if unit has weapon-triangle advantage or if foe initiates combat, unit attacks twice; and if ≥ 2 allies, reduces damage from foe's first attack during combat by 40%; and if ≥ 3 allies, foe cannot make a follow-up attack. At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or if unit is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2, deals +7 damage when Special triggers, and neutralizes effects that grant "Special cooldown charge +X" to foe or inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat.
