|effect=Grants Def+3. At start of turn, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants【Hexblade】and【Null Panic】 to unit and allies within 3 spaces of unit. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, inflicts penalty to foe's Atk/Def = number of【Bonus】effects active on unit, excluding stat bonuses, × 2, + 6 (max 12), and if number of【Bonus】effects active on unit excluding stat bonuses ≥ 3, reduces damage from foe's first attack by X% during combat (if foe can make a follow-up attack, X = 80; otherwise, X = 40; "first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes).<br><br>【Hexblade】<br>Calculates damage using the lower of foe's Def or Res during combat for 1 turn (including damage dealt by Specials before combat).<br><br>【Null Panic】<br>If unit is inflicted with Panic (bonuses converted into penalties), neutralizes the "converts bonuses on target into penalties" effect for 1 turn. (Even though the effect is neutralized, the Panic status remains, and is treated as a Penalty status.)<br><br>【Bonus】<br>All effects that last "for 1 turn" or "that turn only." Includes bonuses granted by a skill like Rally or Hone and positive status effects (extra movement or effects like Dominance).
