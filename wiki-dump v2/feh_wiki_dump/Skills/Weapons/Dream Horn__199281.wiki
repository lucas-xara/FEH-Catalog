|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, inflicts Atk/Def-X on foe (X = 50% of highest total bonuses among unit and allies within 3 spaces of unit +6), unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack during combat, and reduces damage from attacks during combat and from area-of-effect Specials (excluding Røkkr area-of-effect Specials) by 30%. At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2 to unit, inflicts Atk/Def-X on foe during combat (X = number of spaces from start position to end position of whoever initiated combat + 3; max 6), and also, if X ≥ 5, reduces damage from foe's first attack by 30% during combat.
