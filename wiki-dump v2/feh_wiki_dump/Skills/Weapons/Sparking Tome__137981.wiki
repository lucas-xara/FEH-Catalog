|effect=Grants Spd+3. At start of combat, if foe's HP ≥ 50%, inflicts Spd/Res-6 on foe during combat and inflicts penalty on foe's Spd/Res during combat = current bonus on each of foe's stats × 2. (Example: if foe has +7 bonus to Spd, inflicts Spd-20, for a net penalty of Spd-13.) Calculates each stat penalty independently.
