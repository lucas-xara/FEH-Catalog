|effect=Enables【Canto (１)】.<br><br>Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). If unit initiates combat or foe's Range = 2, as combat begins, deals damage to foe = X% of foe's Atk (if unit has weapon-triangle advantage or unit's Spd > foe's Spd, X = 40; otherwise, X = 20; effects that reduce damage during combat do not apply; will not reduce foe's HP below 1). If unit initiates combat or foe's Range = 2, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd = 20% of unit's Spd at start of combat, and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 30% during combat, and restores 7 HP to unit after combat.<br><br>【Canto (１)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move １ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)
