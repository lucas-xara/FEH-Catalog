|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1).<br><br>At start of player phase or enemy phase, inflicts Spd/Def-7 on unit through unit's next action.<br><br>At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 and bonus to Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = current penalty on each of those stats × 2 (example: if unit has -7 penalty to Atk, grants Atk+19, for a net bonus of Atk+12; calculates each stat bonus independently), unit deals damage = total penalties on unit × 1.5 (excluding area-of-effect Specials), neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks, and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 40% during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and restores 7 HP to unit after combat.
