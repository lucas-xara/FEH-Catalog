==Trivia==
* The effect of Barb Shuriken+ is identical to {{Wt|Kagami Mochi+}}<!-- —the only difference between these weapons is that Barb Shuriken+ may be used by randomly generated units (however Kaze is not in the random unit pool, and the weapon is configured to be owner-only, so no random units will equip this weapon either) -->.
