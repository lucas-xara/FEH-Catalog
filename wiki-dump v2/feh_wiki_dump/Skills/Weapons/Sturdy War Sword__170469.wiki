|effect=Grants Atk+3. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit during combat, and if unit's attack can trigger their Special, the following effects will occur based on the number of allies within 4 spaces of unit: If ≥ 1, before unit's first attack, grants Special cooldown count-X (X = 50% of unit's max Special cooldown count value, rounded down) to unit. If ≥ 2, reduces damage from foe's first attack by X% (X = unit's max Special cooldown count value × 10). If ≥ 3, neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks.
