|effect=Grants Def+3. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Def+6 to unit during combat, inflicts penalty on foe's Atk/Def during combat = 20% of unit's Def at start of combat, and foe cannot make a follow-up attack. At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or if unit is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2, deals +7 damage when Special triggers, and neutralizes effects that grant "Special cooldown charge +X" to foe or inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit.
