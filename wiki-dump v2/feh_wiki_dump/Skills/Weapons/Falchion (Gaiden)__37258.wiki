==Trivia==
* The first listed refined effect is a reference to a skill in {{FE|15}} known as "[[Fireemblemwikia:Double Lion|Double Lion]]", which allows the user to [[Consecutive attacks|attack twice]] and is found on the {{St|Royal Sword}}, one of [[Alm|Alm's]] preferred weapons.
**However, later on {{Ut|Celica: Warrior Priestess}} received a more powerful version of this skill, named {{St|Double Lion}}.
