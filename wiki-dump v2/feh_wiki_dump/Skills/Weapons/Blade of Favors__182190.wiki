|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of player phase or enemy phase, if any foes are within 3 rows or 3 columns centered on unit, inflicts Atk/Spd/Def-6 on those foes through their next actions and grants Atk/Spd/Def+6 to unit for 1 turn. If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, inflicts penalty on foe's Atk/Spd/Def during combat = 5 + any current penalty on each of those stats (example: if foe has -7 penalty to Atk, inflicts Atk-12, for a net penalty of Atk-19 during combat; calculates each stat penalty independently) and reduces damage from foe's first attack during combat by 40%.
