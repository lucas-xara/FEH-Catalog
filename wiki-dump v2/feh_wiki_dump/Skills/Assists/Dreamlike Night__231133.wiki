|effect=Grants another action to target ally, and if Canto has already been triggered by target ally, re-enables Canto. Inflicts Atk/Def/Res-7, 【Frozen】, and【Sabotage】on closest foes to target ally and any foe within 2 spaces of those foes through their next actions (cannot target an ally with Sing or Dance; this skill treated as Sing or Dance).<br><br>【Frozen】<br>Reduces inflicted unit's follow-up ability and increases foe's follow-up ability through unit's next action:<br><br>Increases Spd difference necessary for unit to make a follow-up attack by X and decreases Spd difference necessary for foe to make a follow-up attack by X during combat (if foe's Def > unit's Def, X = 10 + difference between Def stats × 2; otherwise, X = 10). (For example, if Spd difference necessary increases by 10, Spd must be ≥ 15 more than foe's Spd to make a follow-up attack; stacks with similar skills.)<br><br>【Sabotage】<br>Inflicts penalty on unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = highest penalty on each stat between unit and allies within 2 spaces of unit through its next action. Calculates each stat penalty independently.
