|effect=Grants another action to target ally. Grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4, "unit can move to a space adjacent to any ally within 2 spaces," and 【Canto (１)】to target ally and allies in cardinal directions of unit and target ally (excluding unit) for 1 turn. (Cannot target an ally with Sing or Dance. This skill treated as Sing or Dance.)<br><br>【Canto (１)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move １ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)
