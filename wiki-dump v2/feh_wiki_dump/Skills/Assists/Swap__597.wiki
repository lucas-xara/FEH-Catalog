==Trivia==
*According to Sharena, the use of Swap appears near instantaneous to the units during battle.<ref>{{RefQuote|Until a second ago, I was in a forest. But then I suddenly found myself on a plain! Plus, I thought Alfonse was on a plain, but then I saw him in a forest! It was like we instantly swapped places!|Sharena, [https://guide.fire-emblem-heroes.com/en-US/015/ Learn with Sharena!]}}</ref>
