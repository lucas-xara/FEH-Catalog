|effect=Grants the following effects to unit and target ally for 1 turn: from turn 1 on, grants Atk/Spd+X (X = number of turns × 2; max 8); from turn 2 on, enables【Canto (１)】; from turn 3 on, grants【Treachery】; and from turn 4 on, grants【Dual Strike】. Grants another action to unit. (Additional action and effects other than stat bonuses granted once per turn only. This skill treated as a Rally Assist skill.)<br><br>【Canto (１)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move １ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)<br><br>【Treachery】<br>Unit deals additional damage = total bonuses on unit for 1 turn.<br><br>【Dual Strike】<br>If unit initiates combat and is adjacent to an ally with Dual Strike (excluding unit), unit attacks twice. (That turn only. Does not stack.)
