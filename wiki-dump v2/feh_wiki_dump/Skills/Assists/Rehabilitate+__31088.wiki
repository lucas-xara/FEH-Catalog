==Notes==
* When the target's HP is above 50%, Rehabilitate+ heals the ally by (50% of healer's Atk − 10). If the result number is too low by falling under 7, then it will instead heal a flat 7 HP instead.
**For example, if a healer has 50 Atk in battle, then the healer will restore 15 HP to the ally, a better amount compared to the default. 
**Another example would be if a healer has 25 Atk in battle, then the healer will restore 5 HP to an ally; Since the lowest amount of healing one can do is 7, the 5 is bumped up to 7 instead.
* When the target's HP is below 50%, Rehabilitate heals an additional (target ally's maximum HP − 2 × target ally's current HP, minimum of 0) HP.
** This can result in [http://i.imgur.com/QFEuTbS.png situations] where the amount of HP restored to the target far exceeds their maximum health. Due to the formula, a target with (50% of healer's Atk − 10, minimum of 7) HP or less [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hrvxiD98zh9e1_O8YV9VOsO-OkVsJYps-h59eK0bcuU/edit?usp=sharing will always be healed to his or her HP maximum], regardless of what that HP maximum is.
* A single formula for both cases is:
** (50% of healer's Atk − 10, minimum of 7) + (target ally's maximum HP − 2 × target ally's current HP, minimum of 0) HP
