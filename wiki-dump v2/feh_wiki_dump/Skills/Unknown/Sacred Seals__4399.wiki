[[File:Feature Sacred Seals.png|250px|thumb|Sacred Seal]][[File:Passive Icon S.png|alt=|right]]
Sacred Seals can be equipped to skill slot [[File:Passive Icon S.png|x26px|class=inline-icon|alt=|link=]], and are effectively movable [[Passives]].

A Seal can be equipped to one hero at a time, and you cannot own more than one of the same Sacred Seal. Any duplicate seals will automatically be exchanged for 300 {{It|Hero Feather}}s.

As a general rule, equipping a Seal at the same time as having the corresponding passive skill equipped makes the effects stack, for example having both the {{St|Breath of Life 3}} '''seal''' and the {{St|Breath of Life 3}} '''passive''' equipped effectively stacks the healing properties of both skills.

Sacred Seals can be earned by completing [[Quests]], clearing [[Squad Assault]] challenges and by earning a high score in [[Tempest Trials]]. They can also be created and enhanced via the [[Sacred Seal Forge]] by using {{It|Sacred Coin}}s.

SP "costs" listed for Sacred Seals in the table below are for arena score calculation purposes.
