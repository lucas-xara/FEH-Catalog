|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). Effective against dragon foes. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+X to unit (X = 20% of unit's Spd at start of combat, + 5), reduces damage from foe's first attack by 40% ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50%, and unit can make a follow-up attack before foe's next attack during combat.
