|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). Effective against dragon foes. If unit is within 3 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit during combat, unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, and also, if unit's attack can trigger their Special, grants Special cooldown count-1 to unit before unit's first attack during combat, and if foe's attack can trigger their Special and unit's Res ≥ foe's Res+5, inflicts Special cooldown count+1 on foe before foe's first attack during combat. (Cannot exceed the foe's maximum Special cooldown.) If foe's Range = 2, calculates damage using the lower of foe's Def or Res.
