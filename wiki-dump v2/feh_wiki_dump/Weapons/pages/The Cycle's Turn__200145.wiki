|effect=Enables【Canto (１)】.<br><br>Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). If unit initiates combat or【Bonus】is active on unit, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, grants Atk/Spd+X to unit (X = number of turns × 2; max 10), deals damage = 20% of unit's Spd (including when dealing damage with a Special triggered before combat), and neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks during combat.<br><br>【Canto (１)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move １ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)<br><br>【Bonus】<br>All effects that last "for 1 turn" or "that turn only." Includes bonuses granted by a skill like Rally or Hone and positive status effects (extra movement or effects like Dominance).
