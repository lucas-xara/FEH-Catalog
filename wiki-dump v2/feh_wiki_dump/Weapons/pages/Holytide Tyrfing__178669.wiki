|effect=Enables【Canto (２)】.<br><br>Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1).<br>If unit or foe initiates combat after moving to a different space, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit during combat and deals damage = X × 10% of foe's Def (X = number of spaces from start position to end position of whoever initiated combat, max 4; excluding area-of-effect Specials), and also, if unit's HP ≥ 25% at start of combat, unit’s HP > 1, and foe would reduce unit’s HP to 0, unit survives with 1 HP. (Once per combat. Does not stack with non-Special effects that allow unit to survive with 1 HP if foe's attack would reduce HP to 0.)<br><br>【Canto (２)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move ２ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)

|effectSkill1=At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res = 5 + number of foes within 3 rows or 3 columns centered on unit × 2 (max 11), reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50% (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and reduces damage from foe's first attack by X during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and reduces damage by X when foe's attack triggers foe Special (X = number of spaces from start position to end position of whoever initiated combat × 3; max 12; excluding area-of-effect Specials), and restores 7 HP to unit after combat.
