|cooldown=-1
|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25% and unit initiates combat, applies【Divine Vein (Flame)】on 5 spaces in a line centered on foe's space and on the 5 spaces behind those spaces (based on direction unit is facing) for 1 turn after combat. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, inflicts Atk/Def-X on foe (X = 15 - number of adjacent allies × 2; min 6), grants Special cooldown count-Y to unit before unit's first attack (Y = number of spaces from start position to end position of whoever initiated combat, max 3; if foe is in a space where allied 【Divine Vein (Flame)】is applied, then the value is treated as 3), and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by percentage = 100 - number of allies adjacent to unit × 30 during combat, and also, if unit has weapon-triangle advantage or if foe is in a space where allied【Divine Vein (Flame)】is applied, neutralizes foe's non-Special "if foe would reduce unit's HP to 0, unit survives with 1 HP" effects during combat.<br><br>【Divine Vein (Flame)】<br>Applies the following effects on space: Acts as difficult terrain for foes with Range = 2 (moving over this space costs +1 movement; does not apply to "cannot be slowed by terrain" effects; movement cost cannot exceed unit's allowed movement). At start of enemy phase, deals 7 damage to foe, and also, as combat begins, deals an additional 7 damage to foe (effects that reduce damage "during combat" do not apply; will not reduce foe's HP below 1). (Divine Vein effects do not stack; replaces any existing Divine Vein effect; Divine Vein effects applied simultaneously cancel each other out.)
