|upgradedEffect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). Effective against armored foes. Neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks during combat. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit and neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat.
|effectSkill1=If a skill compares unit's Spd to a foe's or ally's Spd, treats unit's Spd as if granted +7. If foe initiates combat or foe's HP ≥ 75% at start of combat, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit and reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduces damage by X%" skills by 50% during combat (example: a foe with a "reduces damage by 45%" skill would reduce damage by 23% instead), and also, if unit's Spd > foe's Spd, reduces damage from attacks during combat and from area-of-effect Specials (excluding Røkkr area-of-effect Specials) by percentage = difference between stats × 4 (max 40%).
