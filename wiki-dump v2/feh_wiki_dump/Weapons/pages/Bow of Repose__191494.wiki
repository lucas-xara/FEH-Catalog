|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). Effective against flying foes. At start of turn, if unit's HP = 100% and unit is within 2 spaces of an ally, deals 1 damage to unit and allies within 2 spaces of unit. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≤ 99%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit and inflicts Spd/Def-X on foe during combat (X = number of spaces from start position to end position of whoever initiates combat × 2, + 3; max 11), and also, the following effects will occur based on that number of spaces: if ≥ 1 space, reduces damage from foe's first attack during combat by 30%; if ≥ 2, also neutralizes effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks during combat and effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat.
