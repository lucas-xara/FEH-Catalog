If unit transforms, grants Atk+2, and unit can counterattack regardless of foe's range.<br><br>【Sabotage】<br>Inflicts penalty on unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = highest penalty on each stat between unit and allies within 2 spaces of unit through its next action. Calculates each stat penalty independently.<br><br>【Assign Decoy】<br>If foe's Range = unit's Range and foe initiates combat against an ally within 2 spaces of unit, triggers【Savior】on unit (that turn only; triggers only if unit is not equipped with a skill that can trigger the Savior effect).<br><br>【Savior】<br>Unit takes ally's space, enters combat in ally's place, and receives all after-combat effects.
