|effect=Grants Spd+3. If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, deals 7 damage to foe as combat begins (activates only when unit can attack in combat; effects that reduce damage "during combat" do not apply; will not reduce foe's HP below 1), grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+X to unit (X = 16 - foe's max Special cooldown count value × 2; min 8; if foe does not have a Special skill, X = 8), reduces damage from foe's first attack by 30% ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat, and also, if unit's max Special cooldown count value ≥ 3 and unit's attack can trigger unit's Special, when unit's Special triggers (excluding area-of-effect Specials), neutralizes "reduces damage by X%" effects from non-Special skills. If unit initiates combat, applies【Divine Vein (Flame)】on 5 spaces in a line centered on foe's space (oriented left to right based on the direction unit is facing) for 1 turn after combat.<br><br>【Divine Vein (Flame)】<br>Applies the following effects on space: Acts as difficult terrain for foes with Range = 2 (moving over this space costs +1 movement; does not apply to "cannot be slowed by terrain" effects; movement cost cannot exceed unit's allowed movement). At start of enemy phase, deals 7 damage to foe, and also, as combat begins, deals an additional 7 damage to foe (effects that reduce damage "during combat" do not apply; will not reduce foe's HP below 1). (Divine Vein effects do not stack; replaces any existing Divine Vein effect; Divine Vein effects applied simultaneously cancel each other out.)
