At start of turn, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants "if unit initiates combat, unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack" to unit for 1 turn. After start-of-turn skills trigger, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants any【Bonus】effects active on unit (including stat bonuses; excluding "unit can move 1 extra space" and【Pathfinder】) to allies within 2 spaces of unit for 1 turn. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit during combat and deals damage = 15% of unit's Res (including when dealing damage with a Special triggered before combat).<br><br>【Bonus】<br>All effects that last "for 1 turn" or "that turn only." Includes bonuses granted by a skill like Rally or Hone and positive status effects (extra movement or effects like Dominance).<br><br>【Pathfinder】<br>When an ally moves through unit's space, that space is counted as 0 spaces moved instead of 1 space. (Unit's space can be freely added to ally's normal movement. Applies only to allies with movement types that allow movement through unit's space.)
