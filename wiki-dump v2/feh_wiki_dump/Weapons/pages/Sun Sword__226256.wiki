|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1).<br>Neutralizes "effective against flying" bonuses.<br><br>After start-of-turn effects trigger on enemy phase, converts bonuses on closest foes and foes within 2 spaces of those foes into penalties (does not convert bonuses applied at the same time).<br><br>If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res = number of foes within 3 rows or 3 columns centered on unit × 3, + 5 (max 14), grants Special cooldown charge +1 per attack (only highest value applied; does not stack), deals damage = 20% of unit's Spd (excluding area-of-effect Specials), and reduces damage from foe's attacks by X during combat (if foe is red, green, or colorless, X = 50% of unit's Spd; otherwise, X = 20% of unit's Spd; excluding area-of-effect Specials), and also, when foe's attack triggers foe's Special, reduces damage from foe's attacks by an additional X (excluding area-of-effect Specials).<br><br>If unit initiates combat, applies 【Divine Vein (Flame)】on 5 spaces in a line centered on foe's space and on the 5 spaces behind those spaces (based on direction unit is facing) for 1 turn after combat.<br><br>【Divine Vein (Flame)】<br>Applies the following effects on space: Acts as difficult terrain for foes with Range = 2 (moving over this space costs +1 movement; does not apply to "cannot be slowed by terrain" effects; movement cost cannot exceed unit's allowed movement). At start of enemy phase, deals 7 damage to foe, and also, as combat begins, deals an additional 7 damage to foe (effects that reduce damage "during combat" do not apply; will not reduce foe's HP below 1). (Divine Vein effects do not stack; replaces any existing Divine Vein effect; Divine Vein effects applied simultaneously cancel each other out.)
