==Trivia==
*The effect of this skill was previously bugged. The bug was that if used with a skill that boosts stats when {{St|Sing}}, {{St|Dance}}, or {{St|Gray Waves}} are used, like with {{St|Firestorm Dance}}, when Support Animations are set to Off, bonuses from skills like Firestorm Dance are considered. The <i>correct behavior</i>, not counting {{SEt|bonuses}} from those skills, only worked while Support Animations was set to <i>On</i>.
**Since players were using the bugged behavior of Prayer Wheel, [[Intelligent Systems]] decided to make that the intended behavior, and buffed the skill in {{Version|3.2}} so that Prayer Wheel considers bonuses from skills such as {{St|Earth Dance}} regardless of the setting of Support Animations. The skill's description was updated to reflect this.
