At start of combat, if foe's HP ≥ 50%, grants Atk/Spd+6 to unit during combat, deals damage = 15% of unit's Spd, and also, if foe has bonuses, grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res and inflicts penalty on foe's Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = current bonus on each of foe's stats. Calculates each stat bonus and penalty independently.<br><br>【Canto (Unit 3×3)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move to a space within 3 rows and 3 columns centered on unit.<br><br>(Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Granted movement treated as Warp movement.)
