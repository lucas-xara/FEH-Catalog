==Notes==
* The 100% HP requirement applies to the Atk/Spd/Def/Res +2 as well as the 2 damage after combat.
{{IfUnitAttacked}}
** It drains 2 HP from its wielder when they counterattack, so long as they were at full health at the start of combat. It will NOT drain 2 HP if they don't counterattack and just take the hit however.
