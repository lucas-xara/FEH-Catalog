|effect=Grants Atk+3. Enables【Canto (２)】during turns 1 through 4. If unit initiates combat or is not adjacent to an ally, inflicts Atk/Res-6 on foe during combat and unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack.<br><br>【Canto (２)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move ２ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)

Calculates each stat penalty independently.<br><br>【Schism】<br>Neutralizes Triangle Attack, Dual Strike, and Pathfinder effects active on unit through unit's next action. Unit is excluded from ally Triangle Attack and Dual Strike effects calculated using numbers of allies. When this status (Schism) is neutralized, Triangle Attack, Dual Strike, and Pathfinder effects are also neutralized.
