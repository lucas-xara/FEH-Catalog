|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). If foe initiates combat or foe's HP ≥ 75% at start of combat, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, inflicts Special cooldown charge -1 on foe per attack (only highest value applied; does not stack), and reduces damage from foe's follow-up attack by 30% of unit's Res during combat ("follow-up attack" normally means only the second strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the third and fourth strikes). If foe's Range = 2, calculates damage using the lower of foe's Def or Res.
