|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). If foe uses bow, dagger, magic, or staff, neutralizes effects that prevent unit's counterattacks during combat. If foe initiates combat or foe's HP ≥ 75% at start of combat, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+5 to unit, inflicts penalty on foe's Atk/Spd = 20% of unit's Spd at start of combat, inflicts Special cooldown charge -1 on foe per attack (only highest value applied; does not stack), and reduces damage dealt to unit by 5 when foe's attack triggers unit's Special (excluding Miracle) during combat.
