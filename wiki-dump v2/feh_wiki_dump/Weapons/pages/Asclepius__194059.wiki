|effect=Grants Res+3. Calculates damage from staff like other weapons. At start of turn, if any foe's Res < unit's Res and that foe is adjacent to another foe, inflicts Atk/Res-6 and status preventing counterattacks on that foe through its next action. At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Res+6 to unit and deals damage = total penalties on foe during combat. (If the "calculates damage from staff like other weapons" effect is neutralized, damage from staff is calculated after combat damage is added.)
