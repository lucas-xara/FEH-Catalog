|effect=Calculates damage from staff like other weapons. Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1; max cooldown count value cannot be reduced below 1). For allies within 2 spaces of unit, grants Special cooldown charge +1 to ally per attack (only highest value applied; does not stack), neutralizes their foe's bonuses to Atk (from skills like Fortify, Rally, etc.), and reduces damage from attacks by 30% (excluding area- of-effect Specials) during their combat. If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Res+6 to unit during combat and unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack.
