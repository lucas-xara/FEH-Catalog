|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Res+6 to unit during combat and the following effects will occur based on the value of unit's Res minus foe's Res: If ≥ 1, unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack. If ≥ 5, if foe uses sword, lance, axe, bow, dagger, or beast damage, foe cannot counterattack. If ≥ 10, reduces the percentage of foe's non-Special "reduce damage by X%" skills by 50% (example: a foe with a "reduce damage by 45%" skill would reduce damage by 23% instead).
