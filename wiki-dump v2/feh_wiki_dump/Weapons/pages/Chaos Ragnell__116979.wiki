|effect=Unit can counterattack regardless of foe's range. Grants bonus to Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = current penalty on each of unit's stats × 2. (Example: if unit has -7 penalty to Atk, grants Atk+14, for a net bonus of Atk+7.) Calculates each stat bonus independently.

|upgradedEffect=Unit can counterattack regardless of foe's range.<br><br>Grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit during combat. Grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = current penalty on each of unit's stats × 2 (example: if unit has -7 penalty to Atk, grants Atk+18, for a net bonus of Atk+11; calculates each stat bonus independently). Neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge-X" on unit during combat.
|effectSkill1=At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit and reduces damage from foe's first attack by 7 during combat ("first attack" normally means only the first strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the first and second strikes), and also, when unit's Special triggers, neutralizes foe's "reduces damage by X%" effects from foe's non-Special skills (excluding when dealing damage with an area-of-effect Special).<br><br>At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25% and unit's attack can trigger unit's Special, grants Special cooldown count-X to unit before unit's first attack during combat (X = 50% of unit's max Special cooldown count value).
