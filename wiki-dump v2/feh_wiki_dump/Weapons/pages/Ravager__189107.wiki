|effect=Accelerates Special trigger (cooldown count-1). At start of combat, if unit's HP ≥ 25%, inflicts Special cooldown charge -1 per attack on foe and Atk/Def-6 on foe during combat (only highest value applied; does not stack), and also, if unit is transformed, grants Special cooldown charge +1 per attack to unit during combat (only highest value applied; does not stack). If unit's HP ≥ 25% at start of combat and foe initiates combat, reduces damage from foe's follow-up attack by 80% during combat ("follow-up attack" normally means only the second strike; for effects that grant "unit attacks twice," it means the third and fourth strikes). At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or if unit is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2, and if foe initiates combat, unit can counterattack regardless of foe's range.
