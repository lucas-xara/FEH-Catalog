Foe cannot counterattack.<br><br>At start of turn, if unit is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd+6,【Salvage】, and the following status to unit and allies within 2 spaces of unit for 1 turn: "unit can move to a space adjacent to any ally within 2 spaces."<br><br>For allies with the【Salvage】effect active, when Canto triggers, if ally is within 6 spaces of unit, ally can move to a space within 2 spaces of unit, even if that movement exceeds the Canto distance limit.<br><br>If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants bonus to unit's Atk/Spd = 20% of unit's Spd at start of combat + 6, deals damage = 15% of foe's Atk (excluding area-of-effect Specials; calculates damage from staff after combat damage is added), neutralizes effects that guarantee foe's follow-up attacks and effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks, and neutralizes effects that inflict "Special cooldown charge -X" on unit during combat.<br><br>【Salvage】<br>Enables【Canto (２)】.<br><br>When【Canto Control】is applied to unit, if unit's Range = 1, unit can move 2 spaces with Canto instead of 1 space, and if unit's Range = 2, unit can move 1 space with Canto instead of 0 spaces.<br><br>【Canto (２)】<br>After an attack, Assist skill, or structure destruction, unit can move ２ space(s).<br><br>(Unit moves according to movement type. Once per turn. Cannot attack or assist. Only highest value applied. Does not stack. After moving, if a skill that grants another action would be triggered (like with Galeforce), Canto will trigger after the granted action. Unit's base movement has no effect on movement granted. Cannot warp (using skills like Wings of Mercy) a distance greater than unit would be able to move with normal Canto movement.)<br><br>【Canto Control】<br>Limits the number of spaces target can move with Canto through their next action. If target's Range = 1, target can move 1 space when Canto triggers. If target's Range = 2, target's action ends when Canto triggers.
