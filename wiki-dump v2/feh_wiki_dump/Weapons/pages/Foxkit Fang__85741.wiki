|effect=Grants Res+3. At start of combat, if unit's Res > foe's Res, and if foe uses sword, lance, axe, dragonstone, or beast damage, grants bonus to Atk/Spd/Def/Res = 50% of difference between stats. (Maximum bonus of +8 to each stat.) At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or if unit is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2, and if unit initiates combat, inflicts Atk/Def-4 on foe during combat and foe cannot make a follow-up attack.

|upgradedEffect=Grants Res+3. At start of combat, if unit's Res > foe's Res, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit during combat and also grants bonus to Atk/Spd/Def/Res to unit during combat = 80% of difference between stats at start of combat (min: 0, max: 8). At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or if unit is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2, and if unit initiates combat, inflicts Atk/Def-4 on foe during combat and foe cannot make a follow-up attack.
|upgradedEffect2=Grants Res+3. At start of combat, if unit's Res > foe's Res, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit during combat and also grants bonus to Atk/Spd/Def/Res to unit during combat = 80% of difference between stats at start of combat (min: 0, max: 8). At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or if unit is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2 to unit, inflicts Atk/Def-X on foe during combat (X = number of spaces from start position to end position of whoever initiated combat + 3; max 6), and also, if X ≥ 5, reduces damage from foe's first attack by 30% during combat.

|effectSkill1=If unit initiates combat or is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Spd/Def/Res+4 to unit during combat and the following effects will occur based on the value of unit's Res minus foe's Res: if ≥ 1, inflicts Special cooldown charge -1 on foe per attack (only highest value applied; does not stack), and if ≥ 5, neutralizes effects that prevent unit's follow-up attacks.
