|effect=Grants Def+3.<br><br>At start of turn, if unit is within 2 spaces of an ally, grants Atk/Def+6 and【Bonus Doubler】to unit and allies within 2 spaces of unit for 1 turn.<br><br>If unit is within 2 spaces of an ally, and if unit or allies within 2 spaces of unit have bonuses to Atk/Spd/Def/Res after start-of-turn skills trigger, grants an additional +3 to each corresponding stat for unit and those allies for 1 turn (max 10; calculates each stat bonus independently).<br><br>If unit initiates combat or if unit is within 2 spaces of an ally, inflicts penalty on foe's Atk/Def = 6 + 20% of unit's Def at start of combat, neutralizes foe's bonuses to Atk/Def, neutralizes unit's penalties to Atk/Def, unit makes a guaranteed follow-up attack, and unit deals +X damage during combat (X = highest total bonuses among unit and allies within 3 spaces of unit; excluding area-of-effect Specials).<br><br>At start of turn, if unit is adjacent to only beast or dragon allies or if unit is not adjacent to any ally, unit transforms (otherwise, unit reverts). If unit transforms, grants Atk+2, and also, inflicts penalty Atk/Def-Y on foe during combat (Y = number of spaces from start position to end position of whoever initiated combat, + 3; max 6), and also, if Y ≥ 5, reduces damage from foe's first attack by 30% during combat.<br><br>【Bonus Doubler】<br>Grants bonus to Atk/Spd/Def/Res during combat = current bonus on each of unit's stats for 1 turn. Calculates each stat bonus independently.
