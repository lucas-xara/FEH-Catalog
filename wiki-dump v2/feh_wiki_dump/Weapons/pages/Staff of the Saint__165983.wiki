|effect=Foe cannot counterattack. At start of turn, grants Def/Res+6 to allies within 2 spaces of unit for 1 turn and inflicts【False Start】on foes in cardinal directions of unit with Res < unit’s Res. (If False Start is inflicted at the same time that start-of-turn effects trigger for the opponent, effects other than healing, damage, or Divine Vein will trigger simultaneously.)<br><br>【False Start】<br>Through their next action, target cannot activate skill effects that trigger at start of turn. (Start-of-turn effects that cause unit to transform or that refresh availability of Duo Skills or Harmonized Skills will still trigger. If this effect is neutralized at start of turn by skills like Even Recovery, Odd Recovery, etc., effects that would have triggered at start of turn, like healing and damage, will then trigger.)
